# Unit converter

# A functional webapp for converting measuring values.

This project was done as practice in order to better understand python and front-end languages like HTML and CSS. The original idea came from roadmap.sh.

This project allows the user to do the following: 

- The user can input a value to convert.
- The user can select the units to convert from and to.
- The user can view the converted value.
- The user can convert between different units of measurement like length, weight, temperature, etc (more given below).


A number of measurements measuring weight, length and temperaturehave been chosen as well as a few joke-measurements that I am doing just for fun. 

To install and use: 
1. clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/LearninkMashin/Unitconv.git

2. download dependencies and run the code
pip install -r requirements.txt
python Unitconv.py

3. Then open your browser at (adress)


Enjoy!
