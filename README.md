# Project K

# A functional webapp for blogposting and to serve as portfolio.

This project hope to achieve a functional webiste to serve as portfolio and to allow for blogging by the admin.

- A home page
- An article page
- A functioning contact form.
- Responsive navigation bar.
- Support for dark mode.
- Cloudflare hosting

For admins the website is to have: 
- Dashboard with the full list of articles published along with add, edit and delete options. 
- "Add article" page, structured like a form with title content and details like the date of release.
